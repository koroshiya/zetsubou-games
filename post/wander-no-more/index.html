                      Wander No More is my second personal game project.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Wander No More is a short, free Kinetic Novel set on an “alternate Earth”, and takes place in a land resembling feudal Japan.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Wander No More was developed for the 2016 NaNoRenO game jam.

                      When Kouichirou Nabatame finally worked up the courage to desert his kingdom, he thought his days of bloodshed were behind him. He believed that if he ran far enough, and for long enough, he could leave it all behind. A normal life would finally be his, and he would be able to spend his days peacefully, helping others and protecting their happiness, rather than destroying them without mercy.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      But as Kouichirou knew deep inside his heart, peace would not be his so easily.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      After weeks on the run, Kouichirou passed through Hotsu Village, and the moment he did, he spelled its demise. The Kodokushi, an elite band of samurai he used to lead, slaughtered the village&#39;s residents, then set it ablaze and continued their search.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Powerless to stop them, Kouichirou emerged after his former subordinates moved on, desperate to put out the flames and find himself food and shelter. He moved from house to house, searching for anything edible, until he at last stumbled upon a storeroom, in which he found... a girl.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Orphaned, maimed, and robbed of her village, the girl would undoubtedly die a slow, painful death. Kouichirou knew this, and thus asked the girl a simple question.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      “Do you want to live?”
                      <br><br>
                    
                      But as he prepared to put the girl out of her misery, a fire lit in her eyes. Before she could vocalize her response, the girl, Chiyo, had already conveyed her answer.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      “Then as the one responsible for all of this, it is my duty to make sure that happens. My name is Kouichirou Nabatame, and from this day onward, Chiyo, you are my daughter.”

                              <p>Kouichirou was once the captain of Mirai Kingdom&#39;s Kodokushi, an elite band of samurai devoted to protecting the masses. He is a peerless swordsman, and has been since a young age. Other people have always hated and feared Kouichirou because of his skill with a blade. Despite being an efficient and ruthless killer, Kouichirou is a kind, charismatic man who wants nothing more than to live in peace. Kouichirou initially sees Chiyo as his chance at redemption, but over time he realizes that he&#39;s suited to the role of a family man, and resolves to protect Chiyo with his life.</p>

                              <p>Chiyo was born in Hotsu village, and has lived her entire life cut off from the neighboring kingdoms on either side. Although she could aptly be called a village girl, Chiyo is by no means naive. She has never had many friends, and trust does not come easily to her. Thanks to her disability, there are many things Chiyo cannot do. Chiyo makes up for this by readily applying herself to anything she is able to do, going above and beyond what others expect of her. Outside of her late family, Kouichirou is the one person in whom Chiyo places her trust, albeit hard-earned. She no longer blames Kouichirou for what happened to her village, and instead tries to think about the future.</p>
