                      <br><br>
                    
                      Tomboys Need Love Too! was released on May 12th, 2017.

                      <h5>My Role</h5>
                      <br>

                      For Tomboys Need Love Too!, I was the sole creator, writer, programmer, commissioner, and several other things. However, I did not create any of the art or music for Tomboys Need Love Too!; I merely hired the people who did.

                  <div class="col s12" id="story" style="display:none;">
                    
                      When Kai hears that his next door neighbor, Chris, will be staying with him while her parents are overseas, he thinks nothing of it. They&#39;re best friends, after all, and have been since childhood. Sleepovers are hardly anything new.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      But what Kai doesn&#39;t immediately realize is that he and Chris aren&#39;t children anymore. They&#39;re both 18 year old heterosexuals, neither one of whom has ever been in a romantic relationship, and their feelings towards one another are no longer as simple as they once were. This event could very well push one of them over the edge, changing their relationship forever.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Chris understands this, and as the more emotionally mature of the two, she already knows what she wants to happen. Tomboy or not, Chris is going to use their cohabitation as a chance to show Kai that she is now a young woman. By the time she returns home, she will make Kai see her not as a friend, or &#34;one of the guys&#34;, but as a member of the opposite sex.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Just as Chris&#39;s advances begin to take effect, however, an obstacle appears: Sophie, Kai&#39;s most recent crush. With timing that couldn&#39;t possibly be a coincidence, Sophie suddenly begins to show a very strong interest in Kai.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Could the rumors about Sophie be true? Appearances aside, is she actually a predator with an extremely warped sense of love, who gets off by breaking up couples? Or are those just heinous rumors created out of malice and jealousy? Even if Kai seems to believe that they&#39;re all lies, Chris isn&#39;t so sure, and this difference of opinion will serve as one of the many wedges that Sophie&#39;s presence threatens to force between them.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Will the advances of Sophie, the girl whom Kai has been pining over for months, manage to sway his heart? Or will Chris finally make Kai recognize her as a member of the opposite sex, and convince him that the perfect woman was by his side all along?

He relies on his best friend Chris more than he realizes, though to her chagrin, he has a hard time seeing her as a member of the opposite sex. Conversely, Kai has a crush on Sophie, despite knowing very little about her, but lacks the courage to converse with her properly.</p>

Now that she&#39;s come of age, Chris can&#39;t decide whether she wants Kai to play with her like they used to, or to start seeing her as a girl.</p>
