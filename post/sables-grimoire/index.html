                      Sable&#39;s Grimoire is my sixth personal game project.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Sable&#39;s Grimoire is a Visual Novel. It takes place in a magic academy, and most of the characters are demi-humans, such as elves and pixies.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Sable&#39;s Grimoire was released on May 19th 2018.

                      <h5>My Role</h5>
                      <br>

                      For Sable&#39;s Grimoire, I was the sole creator, writer, programmer, commissioner, and several other things. However, I did not create any of the art or music for Sable&#39;s Grimoire; I merely hired the people who did.

                      <br><br>

                      

                      <br><br>
                    
                  </div>

                  
                  <div class="col s12" id="story" style="display:none;">
                    
                      When Sable is accepted into Amadronia Magic Academy, he believes that his dream of becoming a world-renowned magic researcher is finally within his grasp. As one of the few pure-blooded humans capable of using magic, Sable is hopeful that he’ll find common ground with the demi-human population at the school, and that the next few years of his life will be as productive as they are enlightening.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Unfortunately for Sable, his first day at Amadronia quickly proves to him that this will not be the case. The students in his class are unruly, there’s a pyromanic dragon girl running around, his &#34;teacher&#34; has no interest in teaching, the principal willfully breaks academy rules, and it seems like everywhere he turns, Sable finds one more reason to doubt Amadronia&#39;s proud legacy.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Will Sable manage to survive at this clearly dysfunctional academy? Or will he, like so many others, leave Amadronia feeling utterly disillusioned?

                              <p>Sable is an aspiring magic researcher who often allows his obsession to get the best of him. To Sable, sleep and food are a waste of time, and other human beings are mere distractions. All that matters is his research. While Sable is typically disinterested in other people, demi-humans and other prominent mages are an exception. Sable is interested in demi-humans to the point where some might find his fascination downright creepy.</p>

She is quite aware of her limitations, and ultimately, she doesn&#39;t care. To Eth, Amadronia is simply a place to learn about human culture, and to make friends.</p>

Contrary to her small size, Tix specializes in physical enhancement magic. Her tiny arms wield significantly more power than those of humans three times her size. Tix bears complicated feelings towards human beings, due to her species&#39; reliance on mankind.</p>

                              <p>Rei is a fun-loving and happy girl who makes friends easily, and seldom holds a grudge. She’s also quite air-headed, and a bit of a dunce, not to mention a complete and utter glutton. Her only redeeming trait as a mage is her abnormal talent for spiritual magic, aka. healing magic. Rei aspires to become a nurse or a priestess, and to spend her life healing others, just as the rest of her family have for generations.</p>

                              <p>Hel is a romanticist who often acts without thinking. Androgynous in appearance, Hel pursues men and women alike, and she isn&#39;t one to take no for an answer. Hel is neither strong nor motivated. To her, magic is merely a tool which allows her to hit on hotties of all races and genders indiscriminately. Hel excels at altering her appearance to match the ideals of whoever she is speaking to, and can trick even the strongest of minds into falling for her.</p>

Unfortunately, Narm&#39;s talent for magic is somewhat lacking. Compared to the demi-humans around him, he is a novice at best. Narm compensated for this by actively seeking techniques that even he can use, and people who will join him as brothers in arms.</p>

And yet, students and teachers alike avoid her like the plague. Not because they usually only see her when they&#39;re injured, but because Raphael possesses an unnatural fascination with death. How is it that such a kind, lovely woman inspires so much fear in those around her?</p>
