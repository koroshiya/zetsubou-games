As the two begin to cohabitate, he realizes that he may not be over her after all.</p><p>When his girlfriend suddenly vanished without a word, Cassius feared the worst. All communication was shut off, he had no clue where she went, and nobody seemed to be able to get ahold of her. The person closest to him disappeared, seemingly for good, and he had no way of knowing what had happened to her.</p><p>Now, without warning or fanfare, Maia has returned. What's more, the years of separation have done nothing to change how she feels about Cas. The two of them never formally broke up, and in her mind, they are still a couple.</p><p>But as the person left behind, Cas' feelings aren't so simple. After years of anguish, he has finally started to move on, and Maia's return isn't as welcome now as it would have been all that time ago.</p><p>Will Cas manage to mend his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and return to what they once had? Or will he leave the past behind and find happiness with someone else?</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>

He wields great strength, which the people of his village view as the work of demons, in order to protect everyone, including those who resent him for doing so.</p><p>Forever by Max's side is his childhood friend and love interest,  Celeste. She does not share Max's outlook on life, nor does she condone his desire to become a hero. To her, humans are no better than the demons who oppress them, and she would happily leave their village in flames, if only Max would go with her.</p><p>These two friends go about their days trying to convince each other to see the light. Celeste wants Max to leave behind the villagers who fear and hate him, while Max himself tries to make Celeste understand that they are ultimately good people who are worth saving.</p><p>Will Max manage to convince Celeste that the human race is worth protecting? Or will Celeste prove to Max once and for all that his enemy is not demonkind, but the familiar faces of those who deny his humanity?</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>

He  resumes his high school life in the big city, quickly adapting to the  change in pace, and before he knows it, Hideaki begins to think of this  city as his home once more. <br><br>Hideaki's life in Okutama is upbeat and fun, thanks to the many friends  he makes, including Megumi, an energetic student council member;  Chinatsu, a reserved senior in the literature club; Shiro, an unsociable  music-lover; and Yui, an obstinate girl who rarely expresses herself  honestly. <br><br>Surrounded by an interesting group of friends, Hideaki lives out his  days without a care in the world, content to enjoy a normal high school  life. Whether he's going out with friends or studying for exams, his new  life is truly peaceful. <br><br>But not for long. <br><br>As Hideaki's stay in Okutama continues, ghosts from his past begin to  come back, increasingly intruding on the new life he's trying to build.  As if that wasn't bad enough, his new friends all have secrets of their  own, and the more Hideaki involves himself with their daily lives, the  deeper into mutual despair he sinks. <br><br>Will you be able to put to rest the evils of the past and finally live  out the normal high school life you crave? Will you be able to put your  friends' minds at ease, erasing the trauma and misery ruining their  otherwise peaceful lives? <br><br>Because whether you like it or not, for this very task it can be no one but you.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>
