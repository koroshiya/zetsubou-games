It&apos;s what he&apos;s trained for all his life, and he was all too happy to squander his savings and leave his home behind to make it happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reality of being a knight isn&apos;t so glamorous. What&apos;s common sense for Oren is unthinkable for the knights, and he quickly finds himself tossed out onto the street after failing to adapt.</p><p>Just when Oren thinks his life has hit rock bottom, an adventurer named Litia invites him to join her party. Knights and adventurers are usually mortal enemies, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and Oren isn&apos;t above swallowing his pride in order to survive.</p><p>Oren and Litia bicker to no end. There seems to be very little the duo can agree on. But as a team, the two work together surprisingly well, and the work of an adventurer is nothing like what Oren had imagined.</p><p>Given a glimpse of a different future, will Oren abandon his dream of becoming a knight and embrace his new life as an adventurer?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>

So the game itself is pretty much done, apart from testing.</p><p>Next up is getting a trailer made. This is currently slated for February.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been going through the approval process on Steam. A game trailer is a requirement for Steam, so I can&apos;t quite complete the process just yet, but most of it is squared away.</p><p>Assuming the trailer is completed within the expected timeframe and there are no hold-ups with Steam, this game should be released in February or March.</p><p></p><h3 id="upcoming-old-game">Upcoming old game</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/01/mm1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1184" height="666" srcset="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/mm1.jpg 600w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/mm1.jpg 1000w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/01/mm1.jpg 1184w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I&apos;ve also been working on getting Max Massacre, a short, free game I made a few years ago, onto Steam.</p><p>Much of the process is done. It just needs a trailer before I can try to get it all approved.</p><p>Some things will be added which weren&apos;t present in the original release, such as achievements and cloud saves. I&apos;ll also be looking at adding some new settings I&apos;ve played around with in An Adventurer&apos;s Gallantry, and possibly higher res artwork in places.</p><p>In terms of story content, however, it&apos;ll be the same as the original release.</p><p></p><h3 id="progress-of-my-heart-grows-fonder-update">Progress of My Heart Grows Fonder update</h3><p></p><p>The new content update mentioned in the last blog post is getting closer to completion.</p><p>There are still a couple of CGs left, after which it&apos;ll be testing time.</p><p>In the meantime, I recently wound up releasing an unplanned update for MHGF to fix a Steam Deck issue (more below) which included some things I was going to bundle into the upcoming content update. Most of it was steam-specific though (cloud saves, depot changes), so the update was only released on Steam.</p><p></p><h3 id="progress-of-sables-grimoire-2">Progress of Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2</h3><p></p><p>Nothing to report here, and there probably won&apos;t be for a while.</p><p>It&apos;s being actively worked on every day. But it&apos;s a long game, so it takes a while for anything noteworthy to happen.</p><p>I might start sharing new sprites and/or CGs later on in the year. But right now the focus is on writing, writing, and more writing.</p><p></p><h3 id="steam-deck">Steam Deck</h3><p></p><p>I finally managed to get my hands on a Steam Deck recently. And the very first thing I discovered was that a) Renpy games freeze up on some steam decks and b) mine is one of those steam decks.</p><p>Luckily it&apos;s a problem that&apos;s already been solved in upstream Renpy, so I was able to apply a fix straight away. Though it did mean that my first day or so with the steam deck was spent debugging, patching, compiling and testing.</p><p>Now that that&apos;s sorted I&apos;ll be moving onto improving the experience of my games on this device where possible. The things I&apos;m thinking of at the moment are:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>switching to fonts which are easier to read at smaller sizes</li>
<li>implementing font size settings</li>
<li>implementing sprite size settings</li>
<li>support for different aspect ratios</li>
<li>controller button prompts and general controller support improvements</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Some of this I&apos;ve already released or started testing out for new games.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/01/aag2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/aag2.jpg 600w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/aag2.jpg 1000w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/01/aag2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/01/aag3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/aag3.jpg 600w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/aag3.jpg 1000w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/01/aag3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Of the changes I&apos;ve been looking into, support for multiple aspect ratios is the only one I&apos;m really unsure about.</p><p>At the moment it&apos;s looking like a lot of work, so it might be something I only implement for smaller games, or it might be limited to Steam Deck specific builds (Steam does have an option for this).</p><p>Regardless, I&apos;ll keep an eye out for other changes which might improve things on the Steam Deck. And other platforms/devices, of course.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First blog post]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, folks.

And welcome to my first blog-style post on this website.</p><p>I&apos;ve been meaning to set up a blog of some kind for a while now. Twitter isn&apos;t appropriate for longer posts, and the forums/devlogs on Steam and Itch are game-specific, so I thought a different place would be better for posting general updates.</p><p>I don&apos;t plan for the posts here to follow any kind of schedule or set format. The gap in time from one blog post to the next will probably vary a lot too. But hey, let&apos;s give it a go.</p><p></p><p>Briefly, the updates below include:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Sable&apos;s Grimoire After Story</li>
<li>Sable&apos;s Grimoire console version</li>
<li>Update for Man And Elf, A Dragon&apos;s Treasure</li>
<li>Upcoming update for My Heart Grows Fonder</li>
<li>Upcoming game: An Adventurer&apos;s Gallantry</li>
<li>Other updates</li>
<li>What&apos;s next?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3></h3><h3 id="sables-grimoire-after-story">Sable&apos;s Grimoire After Story</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2022/09/route_afterstory.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/route_afterstory.png 600w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2022/09/route_afterstory.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>First up, at long last, the after story update for Sable&apos;s Grimoire is finally out!</p><p>It is now live on Steam, Itch.io, and Fakku. It will be coming to other stores once they have reviewed the build and approved the update.</p><p>The version number to look out for is: 1.09.0. The other way you&apos;ll know if you&apos;ve got the update is of course the presence of the After Story button on the main menu.</p><p>Clicking on this button brings up a warning, alerting you to the fact that After Story is only meant to be played once you&apos;ve finished all the other routes you intend to play. You don&apos;t want accidental spoilers, after all.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to have a save from a complete playthrough in order to start After Story though. You can play it at any time, even from a fresh new install. After all, Sable&apos;s Grimoire has been out for a few years now, and didn&apos;t have cloud saves (until now!), so requiring someone to play through the game first to unlock After Story seemed like a bad idea.</p><p>Anyway, in case you haven&apos;t been following the thread on Steam outlining the roadmap for Sable&apos;s Grimoire (I swear I&apos;ll come up with something more obvious and easier to find for Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2...) the after story update is about wrapping up the first game in the series and setting the stage for Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2.</p><p>It takes place after specific routes in the first game. To summarize, Lisha&apos;s route leads to Man And Elf, Drakan&apos;s route leads to A Dragon&apos;s Treasure, and the other routes lead to After Story (and then Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2). This is explained a little more in-game when you start playing After Story.</p><p>Also note that After Story is the final planned content update for the first Sable&apos;s Grimoire game. What this means is that the first game will only get general updates (eg. bug fixes, support for new platforms), but not new story content (eg. character routes, endings) going forward.</p><p>Story-related development will of course be focused on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2 and other upcoming games in the series going forward.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the After Story content, this update also includes the following changes:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>added logo for Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2 (shown in the After Story prompt)</li>
<li>game engine updated to Renpy 7.5.3</li>
<li>ARM Linux builds available on some stores (Steam doesn&apos;t support ARM Linux yet)</li>
<li>Android build updated to target Android 13</li>
<li>smoother font rendering for bold, italic, and bold italic fonts</li>
<li>fix for credits page link</li>
<li>better keyboard/controller navigation on some screens</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><h3 id="sables-grimoire-console-version">Sable&apos;s Grimoire console version</h3><p></p><p>Good news: After Story (and Eris&apos;s route) should be coming to Xbox and Switch soon.</p><p>And unlike every other time I&apos;ve said &quot;soon&quot; over the past year, this time around it means &quot;now&quot;. As in, it has already been released, and should have already started rolling out.</p><p></p><p>Bad news: the playstation version hasn&apos;t been approved, and it might take a while.</p><p>Playstation are super strict on anything remotely sexual or involving nudity. It took a long time and a lot of jumping through hoops to get Sable&apos;s Grimoire on the PSN in the first place.</p><p>Apparently they&apos;ve gotten even more strict since then, and the review process will include going back over the existing content again (not just the new content). So chances are it&apos;s going to be a painful, lengthy approval process.</p><p></p><h3 id="update-for-man-and-elf-a-dragons-treasure">Update for Man And Elf, A Dragon&apos;s Treasure</h3><p></p><p>Version 1.01 of Man And Elf and A Dragon&apos;s Treasure is out.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing new story-wise being added here. It&apos;s mostly new artwork and miscellaneous improvements.</p><p>First off, both games are getting new character bio and glossary screens. The old ones were screens I hacked together from the existing GUI artwork, rather than dedicated screens made by the GUI artist. I think the new ones turned out much nicer.

Either late this year or early next year.</p><p>Then comes An Adventurer&apos;s Gallantry. Again, either late this year or early next year.</p><p>There&apos;s also another short, kinetic VN I&apos;ve been working on, but it isn&apos;t as far along in development. More details later. I expect this one to be done early next year.</p><p>After that (or should I say &quot;at the same time&quot;?) I&apos;ll be working on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2. The three games mentioned above are primarily waiting on artwork (ie. not waiting on me), so I&apos;m currently free to work on other things.</p><p>From that point on it&apos;s probably just going to be work on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2 for the foreseeable future. Don&apos;t hold your breath, because it&apos;s going to take a while! I&apos;ll post progress updates and artwork once it&apos;s a decent way through development.</p><p></p><h3 id="thats-all-for-now">That&apos;s all for now</h3><p></p><p>Are you still reading?

All communication was shut off, he had no clue where she went, and nobody seemed to be able to get ahold of her. The person closest to him disappeared, seemingly for good, and he had no way of knowing what had happened to her.</p><p>Now, without warning or fanfare, Maia has returned. What&apos;s more, the years of separation have done nothing to change how she feels about Cas. The two of them never formally broke up, and in her mind, they are still a couple.</p><p>But as the person left behind, Cas&apos; feelings aren&apos;t so simple. After years of anguish, he has finally started to move on, and Maia&apos;s return isn&apos;t as welcome now as it would have been all that time ago.</p><p>Will Cas manage to mend his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and return to what they once had?

He wields great strength, which the people of his village view as the work of demons, in order to protect everyone, including those who resent him for doing so.</p><p>Forever by Max&apos;s side is his childhood friend and love interest, &#xA0;Celeste. She does not share Max&apos;s outlook on life, nor does she condone his desire to become a hero. To her, humans are no better than the demons who oppress them, and she would happily leave their village in flames, if only Max would go with her.</p><p>These two friends go about their days trying to convince each other to see the light. Celeste wants Max to leave behind the villagers who fear and hate him, while Max himself tries to make Celeste understand that they are ultimately good people who are worth saving.</p><p>Will Max manage to convince Celeste that the human race is worth protecting? Or will Celeste prove to Max once and for all that his enemy is not demonkind, but the familiar faces of those who deny his humanity?</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>
