It&apos;s time for another bi-annual update.</p><p>When did they become bi-annual, you ask? They didn&apos;t, really. But that does seem to be how often I post these updates.</p><p>If it&apos;s any consolation, a lack of updates usually means I&apos;m hard at work developing games. It&apos;s actually a sign of progress... in a way.</p><p>So, what&apos;s been happening these past 7 months? And what&apos;s coming next?</p><p>I&apos;ll start with some housekeeping and then get onto the good stuff.</p><h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2><p>With BlueSky now open to the public, I decided to join the platform.</p><p>I&apos;ll continue to post on Twitter/X and Mastodon. So regardless of which platform you use, my posts there will be the same.</p><p>Links to all three can be found in the Socials/Links section of this website.</p><h2 id="website">Website</h2><p>This software used to build this website has been updated from Ghost v5.54.0 to v5.87.2.</p><p>There shouldn&apos;t be any notable changes, and hopefully nothing has broken.</p><h2 id="steam-deck-verified">Steam Deck verified</h2><p>Two more of my games, My Heart Grows Fonder and Sable&apos;s Grimoire, have now been Steam Deck verified.</p><p>The latter is part of the reason why this blog post is a month later than intended. Between Sable&apos;s Grimoire being mid review and the Steam Summer Sale starting, it seemed like a bad time for a blog post.</p><p>Anyway, verified! That&apos;s 7 down and 3 to go.</p><p>Unfortunately the verification process is initiated by Valve. So all I can really do now is wait until they review another one of my games.</p><h2 id="sables-grimoire-2">Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Koko.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>And now, the part you&apos;ve been waiting for.</p><p>It&apos;s been 7 months since the last update, and most of that time has been spent working on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2.</p><p>You may have seen some of my posts on social media with character bios and introductions. Those might give you an idea of how far along the sprites are progressing, but what about the rest of the game?</p><p>Fortunately, the rest is progressing just as smoothly. Let me throw some numbers at you.</p><ul>
<li>18 new backgrounds are complete</li>
<li>31 new CGs are complete</li>
<li>all(?) sprites are complete</li>
<li>just over 500k words done of the writing</li>
<li>new music tracks and GUI not started yet</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what does all of that actually mean?</p><h3 id="artwork">Artwork</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Drakan.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>The total number of backgrounds and CGs needed can&apos;t be confirmed until the writing is complete, so I can&apos;t accurately express those numbers as a percentage.</p><p>With that being said, at this stage I expect another ~5 backgrounds and ~10-15 CGs to be needed, but those aren&apos;t solid numbers.</p><p>Similarly, all of the sprites needed are currently complete, but that might change. Maybe a couple more sprites and outfits will be needed, but overall I don&apos;t expect much to change here.</p><h3 id="writing">Writing</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Lisha.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>500k words sounds like a big number. But is it? It&apos;s hard to make sense of that number without a frame of reference.</p><p>To put that number into perspective, the original Sable&apos;s Grimoire launched at 350k words, and after a few years of updates it is now 585k words in length. So it&apos;s fair to say that the writing for SG2 is pretty far along.</p><p>But let&apos;s not get ahead of ourselves. There&apos;s still a lot of work to be done.</p><p>In particular, the common route (ie. the core part of the game leading up to the individual routes) is not complete. So even though a lot of the game is done, it&apos;s not in a state where it could actually be released, even if some routes were to hypothetically be cut out and released later.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that this is the <em>first draft</em>. That draft is incomplete, and proofreading/editing takes time. So even though a huge portion of the game has been written, it&apos;s still a long way off being &quot;complete&quot;.</p><p>Caveats aside, tons of work <em>has</em> already been done. The writing is coming along well, and everything is progressing smoothly.</p><p>I just don&apos;t want you to see a big number without context and mistakenly think &quot;it&apos;s almost done!&quot;</p><h3 id="routes">Routes</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Eth.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>Excluding music, and without naming which routes they are, the above progress translates into:</p><ul>
<li>Route #1 is complete. Writing, sprites, backgrounds, CGs, everything.</li>
<li>Route #2 is nearing completion. It needs a couple of CGs and a few more scenes need writing. Maybe one more background.</li>
<li>Route #3 needs a bit more work. A few scenes need to be written. 2-3 backgrounds are needed. A few CGs are needed.</li>
<li>Route #4 also needs a bit more work. It needs a few more scenes to be written, a few CGs, and maybe one background.</li>
<li>Route #5 might be pushed back into a post-release update. The CGs are done, and only 1 background is needed. But this is the longest route by far, and there&apos;s still a bit of writing needed, so more artwork might end up being needed.</li>
<li>Routes #6 and #7 have been started, but they&apos;re in the early stages. These won&apos;t be in the initial release.</li>
<li>The common route (ie. the game before it branches off into different routes) still needs a fair bit of work. Mostly writing and some CGs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music-gui">Music, GUI</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Eris.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>Now that the rest of the game is pretty far through, work will soon start on the new music tracks and an updated GUI.</p><p>I usually leave music until later, so it can be matched to particular backgrounds and scenes.</p><p>Likewise, some of the GUI elements need other parts of the game to be finished first to avoid tweaking them later. This is particularly true of the route map screen.</p><p>Fortunately, work on the GUI is a lower priority, since Sable&apos;s Grimoire already has a perfectly good GUI. Updating it is something I&apos;d like to do before SG2 releases, but it doesn&apos;t hold up the development of the rest of the game.</p><p>So both of these will be worked on while the remaining backgrounds, CGs and writing are being finished off.</p><h3 id="testing">Testing</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Rei.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>Once all of the above is finished, it&apos;ll be time to start testing in earnest.</p><p>This part takes a while, and will be done in stages across different operating systems and different sections of the game.</p><p>I plan to start by making sure everything works from start to finish. ie. Someone can actually play the game. Not perfect, but at least playable.</p><p>After that I&apos;ll submit the playable build to Steam so it can be reviewed as early as possible and avoid delays later on.</p><p>While/After they review SG2 I&apos;ll be testing again more thoroughly, looking for things which won&apos;t stop the game from passing review, but which need to be fixed regardless. That means visual bugs, typos, refining scenes, or anything else which comes up.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;ll run through the game from start to finish &quot;as a player&quot;. ie. Not looking for bugs, but trying to play the game all the way through without anything seeming wrong.</p><p>Once I can play the game from start to finish without noticing anything obviously amiss, it&apos;ll be ready for release.</p><h3 id="release-date">Release date?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2024/07/Tix-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blog 2024-07-19" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"></figure><p>I know, I know. Hearing about &quot;progress&quot; is great and all, but when is it going to be ready?</p><p>The remaining artwork should be done over the next few months.</p><p>Music is hard to estimate, but there are fewer new music tracks than there are new pieces of artwork. So I don&apos;t expect it to be a cause for delay.</p><p>The amount of writing needed isn&apos;t huge, but it&apos;s still a few months of work. Followed by editing, which is also not a quick process.</p><p>And of course, testing can&apos;t be done in earnest until all of that is done.</p><p>So, where does that leave the release date?</p><p>If the initial release only includes the first 4 routes, then 2024 seems achievable. If it includes route #5, then Q1 2025 seems more likely.</p><p>For now I&apos;m going to focus on the common route and finishing off the first 4 routes. After that I&apos;ll reassess whether or not to hold up the initial release for the sake of putting route #5 in there, or if it would be better added later as a post-release update.</p><p>So I&apos;m going to disappoint everyone again by holding off on specifying a release date. I&apos;ll put out another blog post in a few months when some routes are fully completed and give a better indication at that time of when I expect the release date to be.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blog 2023-12-23]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Has it really been 6 months already?

While my developer page itself hasn&apos;t changed (not to a noteworthy degree, at least) I have finally gotten around to adding &quot;franchise&quot; links to my games.</p><p>These are the links you&apos;ll see above the game description, near the play/buy button, which link to the developer&apos;s other games.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-from-2023-06-05-09-50-58.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="853" height="103" srcset="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Screenshot-from-2023-06-05-09-50-58.png 600w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-from-2023-06-05-09-50-58.png 853w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I thought I&apos;d added these ages ago, but it turns out I did it wrong.</p><p></p><p>On the Snap Store, aarch64 and armhf builds of my games are now available.

This links to 18+ patches and will link to any other patches if they come up in the future. This is to make it easier for people to find the 18+ patches in countries where Steam doesn&apos;t allow that kind of content.</p><p>The download links on the game pages on this website have all been updated to a (hopefully) more useful format. Previously they were just a bunch of logos images you could click on. Now they are each in a card-like layout and include the store name and supported platforms for that store.</p><p>This website has also moved hosting. Previously it was hosted through Github Pages, but this was problematic with Flathub verification (due to how Github Pages handled the .well-known directory) and sometimes with website updates not propagating. This website is now hosted through Cloudflare instead.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Adventurer's Gallantry]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Oren has always dreamed of becoming a knight.

I&apos;ll also be looking at adding some new settings I&apos;ve played around with in An Adventurer&apos;s Gallantry, and possibly higher res artwork in places.</p><p>In terms of story content, however, it&apos;ll be the same as the original release.</p><p></p><h3 id="progress-of-my-heart-grows-fonder-update">Progress of My Heart Grows Fonder update</h3><p></p><p>The new content update mentioned in the last blog post is getting closer to completion.</p><p>There are still a couple of CGs left, after which it&apos;ll be testing time.</p><p>In the meantime, I recently wound up releasing an unplanned update for MHGF to fix a Steam Deck issue (more below) which included some things I was going to bundle into the upcoming content update.

Though it did mean that my first day or so with the steam deck was spent debugging, patching, compiling and testing.</p><p>Now that that&apos;s sorted I&apos;ll be moving onto improving the experience of my games on this device where possible. The things I&apos;m thinking of at the moment are:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>switching to fonts which are easier to read at smaller sizes</li>
<li>implementing font size settings</li>
<li>implementing sprite size settings</li>
<li>support for different aspect ratios</li>
<li>controller button prompts and general controller support improvements</li>
</ul>

Twitter isn&apos;t appropriate for longer posts, and the forums/devlogs on Steam and Itch are game-specific, so I thought a different place would be better for posting general updates.</p><p>I don&apos;t plan for the posts here to follow any kind of schedule or set format. The gap in time from one blog post to the next will probably vary a lot too. But hey, let&apos;s give it a go.</p><p></p><p>Briefly, the updates below include:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Sable&apos;s Grimoire After Story</li>
<li>Sable&apos;s Grimoire console version</li>
<li>Update for Man And Elf, A Dragon&apos;s Treasure</li>

<li>What&apos;s next?</li>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3></h3><h3 id="sables-grimoire-after-story">Sable&apos;s Grimoire After Story</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2022/09/route_afterstory.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://zetsubou.games/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/route_afterstory.png 600w, https://zetsubou.games/content/images/2022/09/route_afterstory.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>First up, at long last, the after story update for Sable&apos;s Grimoire is finally out!</p><p>It is now live on Steam, Itch.io, and Fakku. It will be coming to other stores once they have reviewed the build and approved the update.</p><p>The version number to look out for is: 1.09.0. The other way you&apos;ll know if you&apos;ve got the update is of course the presence of the After Story button on the main menu.</p><p>Clicking on this button brings up a warning, alerting you to the fact that After Story is only meant to be played once you&apos;ve finished all the other routes you intend to play. You don&apos;t want accidental spoilers, after all.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to have a save from a complete playthrough in order to start After Story though. You can play it at any time, even from a fresh new install. After all, Sable&apos;s Grimoire has been out for a few years now, and didn&apos;t have cloud saves (until now!), so requiring someone to play through the game first to unlock After Story seemed like a bad idea.</p><p>Anyway, in case you haven&apos;t been following the thread on Steam outlining the roadmap for Sable&apos;s Grimoire (I swear I&apos;ll come up with something more obvious and easier to find for Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2...) the after story update is about wrapping up the first game in the series and setting the stage for Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2.</p><p>It takes place after specific routes in the first game. To summarize, Lisha&apos;s route leads to Man And Elf, Drakan&apos;s route leads to A Dragon&apos;s Treasure, and the other routes lead to After Story (and then Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2). This is explained a little more in-game when you start playing After Story.</p><p>Also note that After Story is the final planned content update for the first Sable&apos;s Grimoire game. What this means is that the first game will only get general updates (eg. bug fixes, support for new platforms), but not new story content (eg. character routes, endings) going forward.</p><p>Story-related development will of course be focused on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2 and other upcoming games in the series going forward.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the After Story content, this update also includes the following changes:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>added logo for Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2 (shown in the After Story prompt)</li>
<li>game engine updated to Renpy 7.5.3</li>
<li>ARM Linux builds available on some stores (Steam doesn&apos;t support ARM Linux yet)</li>
<li>Android build updated to target Android 13</li>
<li>smoother font rendering for bold, italic, and bold italic fonts</li>
<li>fix for credits page link</li>
<li>better keyboard/controller navigation on some screens</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><h3 id="sables-grimoire-console-version">Sable&apos;s Grimoire console version</h3><p></p><p>Good news: After Story (and Eris&apos;s route) should be coming to Xbox and Switch soon.</p><p>And unlike every other time I&apos;ve said &quot;soon&quot; over the past year, this time around it means &quot;now&quot;. As in, it has already been released, and should have already started rolling out.</p><p></p><p>Bad news: the playstation version hasn&apos;t been approved, and it might take a while.</p><p>Playstation are super strict on anything remotely sexual or involving nudity. It took a long time and a lot of jumping through hoops to get Sable&apos;s Grimoire on the PSN in the first place.</p><p>Apparently they&apos;ve gotten even more strict since then, and the review process will include going back over the existing content again (not just the new content). So chances are it&apos;s going to be a painful, lengthy approval process.</p><p></p><h3 id="update-for-man-and-elf-a-dragons-treasure">Update for Man And Elf, A Dragon&apos;s Treasure</h3><p></p><p>Version 1.01 of Man And Elf and A Dragon&apos;s Treasure is out.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing new story-wise being added here. It&apos;s mostly new artwork and miscellaneous improvements.</p><p>First off, both games are getting new character bio and glossary screens. The old ones were screens I hacked together from the existing GUI artwork, rather than dedicated screens made by the GUI artist. I think the new ones turned out much nicer.

It tells the story of a disgraced knight who is given a second chance in life as an adventurer.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to release this game either late this year or early next year. More details and the store pages will be available once it&apos;s closer to completion.</p><p>I wrote An Adventurer&apos;s Gallantry to take a break from some of the bigger/longer games I&apos;ve been working on. With those games it can take months or even years before any noteworthy progress is made, so it&apos;s nice to occasionally finish off something short in the meantime.</p><p></p><h3 id="other-updates">Other updates</h3><p></p><p>New builds of my other games (apart from My Heart Grows Fonder, since a bigger update is pending) have also been uploaded.</p><p>They&apos;ve all been updated to the latest version of Renpy, they now target the latest version of Android, and they now have ARM Linux builds.</p><p>Nothing exciting, I know. It&apos;s just a general maintenance update. I&apos;ll continue to provide these in the interest of making sure my games run properly on current platforms.</p><p>I expect there will be another maintenance update soon for Mac M1 support, once Renpy supports building these.</p><p></p><h3 id="whats-next">What&apos;s next?</h3><p></p><p>Some of this has already been mentioned above, but...</p><p>First will be an update to My Heart Grows Fonder. Either late this year or early next year.</p><p>Then comes An Adventurer&apos;s Gallantry. Again, either late this year or early next year.</p><p>There&apos;s also another short, kinetic VN I&apos;ve been working on, but it isn&apos;t as far along in development. More details later. I expect this one to be done early next year.</p><p>After that (or should I say &quot;at the same time&quot;?) I&apos;ll be working on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2. The three games mentioned above are primarily waiting on artwork (ie. not waiting on me), so I&apos;m currently free to work on other things.</p><p>From that point on it&apos;s probably just going to be work on Sable&apos;s Grimoire 2 for the foreseeable future. Don&apos;t hold your breath, because it&apos;s going to take a while! I&apos;ll post progress updates and artwork once it&apos;s a decent way through development.</p><p></p><h3 id="thats-all-for-now">That&apos;s all for now</h3><p></p><p>Are you still reading? I know this post dragged on a bit, but there was plenty to cover.

As the two begin to cohabitate, he realizes that he may not be over her after all.</p><p>When his girlfriend suddenly vanished without a word, Cassius feared the worst. All communication was shut off, he had no clue where she went, and nobody seemed to be able to get ahold of her. The person closest to him disappeared, seemingly for good, and he had no way of knowing what had happened to her.</p><p>Now, without warning or fanfare, Maia has returned. What&apos;s more, the years of separation have done nothing to change how she feels about Cas. The two of them never formally broke up, and in her mind, they are still a couple.</p><p>But as the person left behind, Cas&apos; feelings aren&apos;t so simple. After years of anguish, he has finally started to move on, and Maia&apos;s return isn&apos;t as welcome now as it would have been all that time ago.</p><p>Will Cas manage to mend his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and return to what they once had? Or will he leave the past behind and find happiness with someone else?</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>

With timing that couldn&apos;t possibly be a coincidence, Sophie suddenly begins to show a very strong interest in Kai.<br><br>Will the advances of Sophie, the girl whom Kai has been pining over for months, manage to sway his heart? Or will Chris finally make Kai recognize her as a member of the opposite sex, and convince him that the perfect woman was by his side all along?</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h1>Download Links</h1>
