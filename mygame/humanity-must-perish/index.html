                      Humanity Must Perish is my fourth personal game project.

                      Humanity Must Perish is a short, free Visual Novel set in the future. The main genre is comedy, but there&#39;s also an emphasis on technology/sci-fi.

                      With the human race inching ever-closer to its own destruction, be it from over-population, carbon emissions, or nuclear war, one scientist has taken it upon himself to find a solution to mankind&#39;s problems.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      After countless years of research, and many failed attempts, the professor finally succeeds in creating an android with not only the intelligence to solve the world&#39;s problems, but also the capacity to learn from those around it, and to adapt its approach accordingly.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Named Kyuu, this android is the professor&#39;s greatest and final hope. He doesn&#39;t have many years left, so Kyuu&#39;s clean, renewable power source and ability to self-maintain mean Kyuu will be able to carry on the professor&#39;s work long after he is dead. With unrivaled processing power and a sophisticated artificial intelligence, Kyuu may yet realize the professor&#39;s dream, and it is no exaggeration to say that the future of mankind rests in Kyuu&#39;s hands.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      The only problem is, Kyuu has no desire to save humanity.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Humans got themselves into this situation. Their greedy nature and inability to accept the harsh truths revealed to them make it impossible for them to reform. Saving humanity is a waste of time. For the sake of preserving the planet, humanity must perish. That is what Kyuu believes.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Hearing Kyuu&#39;s thoughts on the matter, the professor devises a plan. He transfers Kyuu into the body of a smaller, more human-like machine, with a body akin to that of a young woman. He then dresses her up to make her look like a high school girl and sends her out into the world, hoping that if she gains some real-world experience, Kyuu might have a change of heart.
                      <br><br>
                    
                      What will Kyuu do during her time in the outside world? What kinds of people will she encounter on her journey, and how will their behavior affect her judgment? Finally, when her time is up, will Kyuu opt to save humanity? Or will she wipe mankind from the face of the planet?
                      <br><br>
                    
                      Whatever her decision may be, the impressions Kyuu leaves on those she meets won&#39;t soon be forgotten. She is sure to be a harsh critic, and for a race as flawed as mankind, her observations and misunderstandings will be boundless.

                    For Humanity Must Perish, I was the sole creator, writer, programmer, commissioner, and several other things. However, I did not create any of the art or music for Humanity Must Perish; I merely hired the people who did.
